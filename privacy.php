<div id="how-we-use-personal-information"></div>
<h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
<p class="tj">We take steps designed to ensure that only those employees who need access to your personal information to fulfil their employment duties will have access to it. We may use the personal information we collect to:</p>

</ul class="list">
<div id="how-we-share-personal-information"></div>
<h2>How We Share Personal Information</h2>
<p class="tj">We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement and governmental entities when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies. We may also disclose your personal information to a third party in the event of any potential or completed reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business.</p>
<p class="tj">We rely on third party services providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf, such as identity verification, detection of fraud or security threats, telephone or technical support, payment card processing, hosting services, and data storage or processing, and we may transfer your personal information to our service providers for such purposes. Third party service providers have access to and may collect personal information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
<p class="tj">When we disclose your personal information to third parties, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this Privacy Policy are complied with and that such third parties provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information.</p>
<div id="information-security"></div>
<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p class="tj">We take your privacy very seriously and have implemented physical, organizational and technological security measures with a view to protecting your personal information from loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. In particular, we encrypt the Stocky website with SSL; we periodically review information collection, storage, and processing practices; and we restrict access to your information on a need-to-know basis for our employees, contractors, and agents who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<p class="tj">Despite the measure outlined above, no method of information transmission or information storage is 100% secure or error-free, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<div id="retention-of-personal-information"></div>
<h2>Retention of Personal Information</h2>
<p class="tj">We will use, disclose or retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which that personal information was collected and as permitted or required by law.</p>
<div id="rights-regarding-your-personal-information"></div>
<h2>Rights Regarding Your Personal Information</h2>
<p class="tj">Under certain circumstances and in accordance with the GDPR or other applicable data protection laws, you have the following rights:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li class="pv2">Access – ask if we are processing information and, if we are, request access to your personal information. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold and certain other information about you;</li>
<li class="pv2">Correction – request that any incomplete or inaccurate personal information about you that we hold be corrected;</li>
<li class="pv2">Erasure – ask us to delete or remove your personal information in certain circumstances. There are certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal information is required for compliance with law or in connection with legal claims;</li>
<li class="pv2">Restriction – ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information, for example, to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it;</li>
<li class="pv2">Transfer – request the transfer of certain personal information to another party;</li>
<li class="pv2">Objection – challenge our processing of personal information based on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) or for direct marketing purposes.  However, we may be entitled to continue processing information in certain circumstances;</li>
<li class="pv2">Automated decisions – contest any automated decision made where it has a legal or similar significant effect and ask for it to be reconsidered; and</li>
<li class="pv2">Consent – where we are processing personal information with consent, withdraw your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p class="tj">You also have a right to make a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority, in particular in the Country (as defined below) where you normally reside, where we are based or where an alleged infringement of data protection law has taken place.</p>
<div id="direct-marketing"></div>
<h2>Direct Marketing</h2>
<p class="tj">Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time send direct marketing materials promoting services, products, facilities, or activities to you using information collected from you. If you no longer want to receive marketing-related communications from us, you may opt-out of such communications by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of emails you receive from us. You may also opt-out by contacting us directly using the contact information in the “Contact Us” section below. We will endeavour to respond to your opt-out request promptly, but we ask that you please allow us reasonable time to process your request. We will not provide your information to third parties for direct marketing or other unrelated purposes without your written consent.</p>
<p class="tj">Please note that if you opt-out from receiving marketing-related communications, we may still need to send you communications about your use of our products or services, or other matters, subject to applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<div id="data-transfer"></div>
<h2>Data Transfer</h2>
<p class="tj">Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country, province or state (each a “<strong>Country</strong>”) where we have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. As a result, your personal information may be transferred to Countries outside your Country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your Country. While such information is outside of your Country, it is subject to the laws of the Country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other Country, pursuant to the laws of such Country. However, our practices regarding your personal information will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the GDPR requirements of providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from the EU/EEA to other countries.</p>
<div id="third-party-websites-and-services"></div>
<h2>Third Party Websites and Services</h2>
<p class="tj">This Privacy Policy applies only to the Stocky Services and does not extend to any websites or products or services provided by third parties. We do not assume responsibility for the privacy practices of such third parties, and we encourage you to review all third party privacy policies prior to using third party websites or products or services.</p>
<div id="childrens-privacy"></div>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p class="tj">The Stocky Services are not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Stocky Services at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personal information has been collected on the Stocky Services from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>
